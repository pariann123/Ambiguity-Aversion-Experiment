# Ambiguity Aversion experiment

Designed a GUI experiment to replicate the psychology experiment
reported by Pulford & Collman (2008)
showing the persistence of the ambiguity
aversion effect irrespective of urn size. 

The rational behind the experiment is as follows:
"When attempting to draw a ball of a specified color either from an urn containing 50 red balls and 50 black balls
or from an urn containing an unknown ratio of 100 red and black balls, a majority of decision makers prefer the
known-risk urn, and this ambiguity aversion effect violates expected utility theory. In an experimental
investigation of the effect of urn size on ambiguity aversion, 149 participants showed similar levels of aversion
when choosing from urns containing 2, 10, or 100 balls. The occurrence of a substantial and significant
ambiguity aversion effect even in the smallest urn suggests that influential theoretical interpretations of
ambiguity aversion may need to be reconsidered."
